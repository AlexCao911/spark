  "title": "The Silent Mutation",
  "summary": "When a rogue genetic experiment leaks into the city, a once-quiet lab becomes the birthplace of terrifying new lifeforms—forcing a scientist to confront the consequences of playing god.",
  "narrative_text": "In a secluded underground lab, Dr. Elara Voss works late, her obsession with creating resilient organisms for medical breakthroughs blinding her to the risks. One night, a containment breach releases a genetically engineered bacterium designed to enhance cellular regeneration. Within hours, stray cats and rats begin mutating—growing razor-sharp claws, glowing eyes, and an unnatural intelligence. The city remains unaware at first, but soon reports flood in: animals acting with purpose, attacking only those who’ve harmed nature. Dr. Voss discovers the truth too late—the bacteria isn’t just altering biology; it’s evolving empathy, targeting the unethical. As the mutated creatures gather outside her lab, she realizes they’re not monsters—they’re a warning. In a final act of defiance, she broadcasts her findings live, urging humanity to reconsider its relationship with science and the natural world. The screen fades to black as the camera pans over the first true sign of peace: a mutated fox gently placing a flower on a dead human’s grave.",
