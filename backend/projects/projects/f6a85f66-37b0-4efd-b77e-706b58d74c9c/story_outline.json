  "title": "The Genesis Experiment",
  "summary": "A reclusive scientist pushes the boundaries of biology, unleashing a creature born from his own ambition—only to realize too late that some mutations defy control.",
  "narrative_text": "Dr. Elias Voss, a brilliant but isolated geneticist, works in a hidden underground lab where light flickers like a heartbeat and the air hums with suppressed energy. He’s spent years perfecting an experiment designed to enhance human resilience through targeted DNA manipulation—a project he believes will save humanity from its own fragility. But when the final serum is injected into a test subject, something goes wrong: the creature doesn’t evolve—it transforms. Its body shifts unnaturally, limbs elongating, eyes glowing with an alien intelligence, and skin rippling like liquid mercury. The lab alarms blare as the creature breaks free, not with rage, but with eerie calm. It walks toward Elias—not to attack, but to observe him, as if it has already learned what makes him human. In that moment, Elias realizes the truth: this isn’t just a mutation—it’s a new form of life, one that sees him not as a creator, but as a specimen. As the camera lingers on the creature’s face—half-human, half-unknown—the screen fades to black, leaving only the sound of a slow, deliberate breath.",
