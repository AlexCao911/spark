# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Spark AI Video Generation Pipeline is an innovative artificial intelligence system that transforms user creative ideas into complete video narratives. The system provides an end-to-end workflow from initial concept brainstorming through final video production, utilizing multiple specialized AI agents orchestrated through CrewAI framework. The pipeline consists of three main phases: interactive chatbot-guided ideation, outline and visual confirmation, and automated video production by professional AI agent teams.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to interact with an AI chatbot to develop my video ideas, so that I can transform rough concepts into structured, detailed creative briefs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a natural language video idea THEN the system SHALL engage them through GPT-4o powered chatbot interface
2. WHEN the chatbot interaction is complete THEN the system SHALL output a structured JSON format containing theme, characters, and plot details
3. IF the user's input is unclear or incomplete THEN the chatbot SHALL ask clarifying questions to gather necessary details
4. WHEN the user provides creative input THEN the system SHALL preserve the original creative intent while adding structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to review and confirm generated story outlines and character designs before video production, so that I can ensure the AI interpretation matches my vision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chatbot phase completes THEN the system SHALL generate preliminary story outline and character designs including both JSON descriptions and visual character images
2. WHEN character designs are created THEN the system SHALL generate actual character images using image generation models for visual confirmation
3. WHEN story outline and character images are generated THEN the system SHALL present both textual descriptions and visual images to the user for explicit confirmation
4. IF the user requests changes to character appearance THEN the system SHALL regenerate character images until approved
5. WHEN the user confirms both the outline and character visual designs THEN the system SHALL proceed to automated video production
6. IF the user does not provide explicit confirmation THEN the system SHALL NOT proceed to video generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want AI agents to automatically develop detailed stories and prepare video generation prompts, so that my confirmed ideas can be transformed into production-ready specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user confirmation is received THEN the Script Generation Crew SHALL activate with Story & Character Designer and Storyboard & Prompt Engineer agents
2. WHEN the Story & Character Designer processes user_idea_json THEN it SHALL expand it into detailed scene-by-scene plot_outline_json using Qwen3
3. WHEN character descriptions are provided THEN the system SHALL generate both JSON character descriptions and actual character design images with consistent visual appearance using image generation models
4. WHEN the Storyboard & Prompt Engineer processes plot_outline_json THEN it SHALL convert it to VEO3-optimized shot-specific video prompts
5. WHEN generating video prompts THEN the system SHALL ensure character appearance and scene detail consistency across all shots
6. WHEN prompt generation completes THEN the system SHALL output veo3_prompts_list with shot_id, veo3_prompt, and duration for each segment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want AI agents to automatically generate video clips and assemble them into a final video, so that I can receive a complete video without manual video editing work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN veo3_prompts_list is available THEN the Video Production Crew SHALL activate with Video Clip Generator and Video Editor agents
2. WHEN the Video Clip Generator receives prompts THEN it SHALL iterate through each prompt in veo3_prompts_list
3. WHEN processing each prompt THEN the system SHALL call VEO3 API to generate independent video clips
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle API responses and potential errors gracefully
5. WHEN all video clips are generated THEN the Video Editor SHALL concatenate clips in sequential order
6. WHEN concatenating clips THEN the system SHALL perform basic post-production including simple transitions and MP4 format conversion
7. WHEN video assembly completes THEN the system SHALL output the final full_video_file_path

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to have robust error handling and API management, so that the video generation pipeline can handle failures gracefully and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any external API call fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL queue requests and respect rate limiting
3. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
4. WHEN video generation fails for a specific clip THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative approaches or skip with user notification
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL preserve user progress and allow resumption from the last successful step

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to maintain modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, so that individual components can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing chatbot functionality THEN it SHALL be contained within src/spark/chatbot/ module
2. WHEN implementing CrewAI agents THEN they SHALL be organized in separate crews (script/ and maker/) with dedicated agents.py and tasks.py files
3. WHEN implementing external API calls THEN they SHALL be encapsulated in src/spark/tools/ directory with dedicated tool files
4. WHEN implementing the main workflow THEN it SHALL be orchestrated through src/spark/main.py as the primary entry point
5. WHEN adding new functionality THEN it SHALL follow the established modular structure and naming conventions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to support configurable AI models and API endpoints, so that different AI services can be integrated or swapped based on availability and performance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables for API keys and model endpoints
2. WHEN different AI models are specified THEN the system SHALL support GPT-4o for chatbot interactions and Qwen3 for story development
3. WHEN video generation is required THEN the system SHALL support VEO3 model integration through dedicated API wrapper
4. WHEN image generation is needed THEN the system SHALL support configurable image generation models (DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion)
5. IF API endpoints change THEN the system SHALL allow configuration updates without code modifications
